- Automatic stars procedural generation with python script, reading of the file in the c++ code and drawing of the stars with variable size far away in the sky. 
The drawing is done using instances to increase performance !!!
- cubemap/skybox in space
- Blinn-Phong's light algorithm (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- light attenuation with distance
- 3 different types of lightsources (point light, directional, spotlight/flashlight) with their own class
- use of emission maps for other light sources on the object itself (as well as diffuse and specular maps)
- 6DOF camera with smooth controls, and "sprint"
- Model and Mesh class modified for importantion of OBJ files and use of their base materials as well as multiple texture and other maps
- use of face culling when relevant for a performance increase
