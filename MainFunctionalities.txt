- Automatic stars procedural generation with python script, reading of the file in the c++ code and drawing of the stars with varying size far away in the sky. 
The drawing is done using instances to increase performance !!!
- Asteroid drawing using instancing as well
- cubemap/skybox in space
- Blinn-Phong's light algorithm (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- light attenuation with distance (makes sense as we are in space, very long distance but not highly realistic)
- 3 different types of lightsources (point light, directional, spotlight/flashlight) with their own class
- use of emission maps for other light sources on the object itself (as well as diffuse and specular maps)
- 6DOF camera with smooth controls, and "sprint"
- Model and Mesh class modified for importantion of OBJ files and use of their base materials as well as multiple texture and other maps
- use of face culling when relevant for a performance increase
- reflection map (for metallic effect of the ship) using reflection mapping
- outlining of the model using stencil buffer
- (background music)

- sun shader, moving with time and lighting corona
- water ripple shader in stargate, sum of 4 circular wave and a spiral, moving with time
- explosion effect using the normals and geometry shader
- launchable missile with cooldown
- particle effects for the missile

keybindings:
